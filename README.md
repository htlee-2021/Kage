Our website is coded out using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and VueJS
We made use of weather and google maps API
We deployed our website on firebase

Disclaimer:
Originally, our website were to implement these features:
- Filtering by industry, interest, duration
- Students to create and edit their profile, including some personal information (picture, level of education, interest)
- Job recommendations based on indicated interests 
- Students applying to jobs
- Companies to list their job (includes job description and potential skills they would be exposed to) for shadowing
- Companies can also write feedback on students who do well
- Gamification element eg. complete 5 job shadowing badge, new skill attained.

However, our website is mostly static. This is obviously not our intention but due to the time constraints and half of our members falling sick, it was difficult to code out a dynamic website and deploy it in time. Thus, we choose to create a static website that would simulate how the website would function if done properly.
